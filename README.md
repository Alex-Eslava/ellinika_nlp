# Ελληνικά NLP

This is a small personal project tackling NLP use cases for the greek language. 
The main aim is to develop some large language models trained on low resource languages (and hardware hehe) with the added difficulty of working with a different alphabet. 

The project layout is simple, notebooks is the playground area while src includes scripts and config files needed for the tasks, cognitive friction free I believe. 

## Use Cases

- DONE:
    - Catalan to Greek mT5 small
- WIP:
